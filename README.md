# adventofcode2020

Advent of Code is an anual coding challenge that occurs December 1st-25th each year. Each day there are two challenges. The first is unveiled at midnight, and upon successfully submitting the answer a user is presented with the second challenge. All users are presented with the same challenges, but input data is unique per user and so answers are unique per user as well.
